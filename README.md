# tf is this?
steam-guard is a simple tool based on [SteamAuth](https://github.com/geel9/SteamAuth) that can be used to generate Steam Guard codes.

I made this because
1. I was learning C.
2. I was bored.
3. I spent a few hours trying to compile [SDA](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) on Linux (to no avail) and got upset.
4. I needed a very simple way of getting Steam Guard codes and writing a node.js script wasn't an option.

# Compiling
1. Make sure you have `make`, `gcc, `libcurl4-openssl-dev` and `libssl-dev` installed
2. Run `make`
